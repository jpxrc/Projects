* Select one of four different species each with different attributes
* Roll to move around the game board and select the corresponding card type based on the slot you land on
* Cards can affect your species randomly or can either help or harm your species based on your current attributes
* If you or your opponent lands on a battle slot, you must each roll and the lowest roller loses points (population level)
* The game ends when a player reaches a population level of zero!

This program is fully functional and can executed by compiling and running https://github.com/jpxrc/Projects/blob/master/XtinXion/XtinXion/src/XtinXion/XtinXionGUI.java
