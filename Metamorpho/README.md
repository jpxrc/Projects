### Metamorpho is a real-time polyphonic virtual synthesizer that uses subtractive synthesis.
#### This was a final project in my object-oriented design class and was implemented in C++. I also designed the synthesizer graphic from scratch in Photoshop.

#### Metamorpho features:
* *Metamorpho* is portuguese for metamorphism or shapeshifter.
* Uses VST2 technology so that you can import the synth into your favorite Digital Audio Workstation and make some million dollar beats
* You may need to set the audio device settings in order to hear sound
* You can click on the keys to produce sounds or you can hook-up a MIDI controller
* For each oscillator, you can select the base waveform and mix the two together for interesting sounds
* Use the filter, envelope generator, and filter envelope to shape your sound to your liking
* Use the low-frequency oscillator to make that wobble-wobble dubstep sound

Metamorpho is a fully-functional executable and can be ran (compiled for windows) by running: https://github.com/jpxrc/Projects/blob/master/Metamorpho/build-win/app/Win32/bin/Metamorpho.exe

If for some reason the above executable is removed (for security purposes), you can extract the following fodler to get the same executable: https://github.com/jpxrc/Projects/blob/master/Metamorpho/build-win1.zip
