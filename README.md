# Programming Projects
This is an ever-evolving list that I have broken out into different categories ranging from projects, course-related assignments, and useful tricks I've learned along the way*. 

### [Metamorpho](https://github.com/jpxrc/Projects/tree/master/Metamorpho): A real-time polyphonic software synthesizer based on subtractive synthesis technology (C++)
### [XtinXion](https://github.com/jpxrc/Projects/tree/master/XtinXion/XtinXion): An educational digital card game that demonstrated concepts of evolution and population dynamics (Java)
### Evolutionary Computation for solving the Unbounded Knapsack problem (Python)
### Classifying communication signals from insects (Matlab)
### Using RetinaNet for detecting objects in high-resolution satellite imagery (Python)
### Classifying sarcasm in Reddit corpora using Recurrent Neural Networks (Python)

*- Some directories may not be available yet due to pending proposals or because I haven't gotten around to packaging everything up nicely =)
